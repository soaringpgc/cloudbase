CloudBase Plugin
================

CloudBase is a plugin for Wordpress to provide features for managing a flying club, specifically
a glider club operation. CloudBase is the core module and it is expected plugins dependent on
these core functions will also be developed. A key feature of CloudBase is the addition of 
many RESTfull endpoints to aid in the development of those additional features. Wordpress 
provides the core features of user management although a plugin such as "Members" is highly
recommended.  

### Roles
Cloud Base relies on Wordpress Roles. And add several of it's own: Treasurer, Tow Pilot, CFI-G, Operations, Chief Tow Pilot, Chief CFI-G, Inactive and Board Member. These Roles 
control who has access to various functions in the Plugin and give authority for the various Sign offs. 

CloudBase Admin features
------------------------

Once CloudBase is activated a new sub-menu, called "Cloud Base" will be available in the "Settings" Menu. Several Tabs are 
available under this submenu. The first that needs to be configured is the "Basic Configuration Page" on this page you will need
to enter your flying club name, a short or nick name, set you altitude units (meters/feet), Fiscal Year, and Start of your flying Season. 
Under the "Equipment Types" tab you will need to enter the types of equipment you wish to keep track off. Tow Planes and Gliders are 
pre-configured. Using ShortCodes you can creat pages where you may track Registration, Annual and Transponder due dates of the Equipment
entered here. Under the "Status Types" tab you can enter possible statues for your equipement. Available and Grounded are preconfigured. 
You may also set a color code. This color will be used in the Status Shortcode to display the Competition ID to give a quick display of 
available and grounded aircraft. The "Flights Types" tab allow you to set up different types of flights. "Regular" is preconfigured, you
might want to add "AOF" or instruction, etc. 

With the above set up you can star to enter the Actual aircraft and equipement your club uses under the "Equipment" tab. Glider and Tow plane
types require, Registration, Make and Model. (Registration, Annual, and Transponder Due dates will be entered using the status Shortcode, see below.)

The final tab "Sign Off Types" is where you enter "Sign offs" for your members. A Sign off might be "Dues Paid", "Annual flight Review", "Checked out to fly XYZ" etc. 
You will need to enter a title, who is the authority to sign off, (CFI-G, Tresurer, etc), effective period, and if not having the sign off is a reason to be on the "No fly" list. 
It can also be marked as being applied automatically to everyone. 

CloudBase Shortcodes
--------------------

CloudBase currently has two Short Codes: "display_flights", and "display_status". "display_status" displays a short one or two line list of all of the 
status of aircraft(tow plane or glider) listed in the Admin Equipment tab by Competition ID. The "Display_Status" shortcode accepts one option; details="true". When this 
option is used the shortcode will display a table of all equipment, this table includes: Registration, Competition ID, Model, Status, Annual due, Registration Due, Transponder Due, 
comments. If the loged in user has admin rights this table will be editable and updatable.
